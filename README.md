# MPV Single Instance Script

This repository contains a Lua script that forces **MPV to behave as a single-instance player**. When you open a second video, it sends the file to the already running MPV window and closes the new instance automatically.

## Installation
Place `single_instance.lua` inside your MPV `scripts/` directory.
